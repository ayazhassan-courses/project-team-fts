The code can work on any PC which has idle installed or any other IDE where Python works

Along with that the user will have to install tkinter library

After installing the library user will have to put the file which the user wants to compress and the code in same folder

Once done with this, user will have to run the code and will have to enter the name of the file in the window appearing. The file name should be correct unless the compression won't work.

Same for decompression as well
